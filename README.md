Mathematica, Python, and Julia code associated with the paper "Symplectic decomposition from submatrix determinants" by Jason L. Pereira, Leonardo Banchi, and Stefano Pirandola.


"Constructing the symplectic basis.nb" contains a Mathematica implementation of the algorithm as well as several examples of its use.

"symplectic.jl" contains a Julia implementation of the algorithm and "Test.ipynb" is a demonstration of how to use the implementation.

"symplectic_decomposition.py" contains a Python implementation of the algorithm and a demonstration of how to use it.
